# Measure your egoism

1. Sign in with your Instagram account.
2. Select photos in which you are.
3. Get result for your account.

# Installation

vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
make run

Go to http://localhost:8000 and enjoy!

Warning! It takes more than 20 minutes to compile and install OpenCV,
so complite provisioning could take around 30 minutes.
