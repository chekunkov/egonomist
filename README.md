# Measure your egoism

1. Sign in with your Instagram account.
2. Select photos in which you are.
3. Get result for your account.

P.S. It works slowly (downloading your instagram photos) :-)

# Installation

1. ```vagrant up```
2. ```vagrant ssh```
3. ```cd /vagrant```
4. ```make run```

Go to http://localhost:8000 and enjoy!

Warning! It takes more than 20 minutes to compile and install OpenCV,
so complite provisioning could take around 30 minutes.
